## Dashboard Creation

**Note: Click on any image to enlarge it.**

1. I downloaded the sample sales dataset, opened it, and created three new worksheets:
- One named 'Working Sheet' to duplicate the raw data, allowing me to make alterations while preserving the integrity of the original raw data
- One named 'Pivot Tables' where I create the pivot tables and their visualizations
- One named 'Dashboard' where I will, of course, create the dashboard

2.  In the 'Working Sheet' worksheet, I cleaned the data by:
- Changing the column headers to filters and adjusting the width of the columns

- Removing duplicates and replacing `M` and `S` in `Marital Status` with `Married` and `Single` and `M` and `F` in `Gender` with `Male` and `Female`

- Formatting the `Income` column as a Currency number format without decimals, given that all values are whole numbers, and adding a new `Age Bracket` column to group the age data for better visualization.

3. In the 'Pivot Tables' worksheet, I created some pivot tables and visualizations with interesting data:
- The average income across gender of those who purchased a bike and those who didn't

- The number of customers within each age bracket that purchased a bike and those who did not

- The number of customers who purchased a bike and who didn't relative to their commute distance

4. In the 'Dashboards' worksheet, I copied the visualizations from the 'Pivot Tables' worksheet over and formatted them to my liking to create a visually appealing, yet easy to understand dashboard to relay some interesting sales information.
